# stfuWOW64

### WTF?

Lacking any feasible way to globally disable 32bit WOW64 emulation support on modern Windows installations, this is a library to gracefully exit any initalizing process that leverages the WOW64 subsystem.

### Why?
Security reasons? Maybe because it's 2019 and unless you have specific use-cases, 32 bit software should no longer exist?
